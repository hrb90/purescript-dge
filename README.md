# purescript-dge

The goal is to port a [directed graph editor](http://bl.ocks.org/rkirsling/5001347) made with d3 to PureScript, with the intention of using it in an [interactive explanation of Kripke semantics](http://github.com/hrb90/kripke) (much like [the original](https://github.com/rkirsling/modallogic)).
